#Verdict.py tries to use the sma, bollinger bands,ema and macd and rsi in order to create a verdict how the user should trade
#The verdict is based on the following rules:
#Out of the 5 indicators, if 3 or more indicate buy/sell, the verdict is buy/sell
#If only 1,2 indicator indicates buy/sell, the verdict is hold
#If none of the indicators indicate buy/sell, the verdict is hold
#Note: This is a very simple approach and should not be used for real trading decisions. It is just for educational purposes.
