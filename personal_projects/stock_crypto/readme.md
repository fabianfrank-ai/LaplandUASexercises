## Stock market analyser

# How does it work?
It fetches data from yfinance(yahoo finance), uses simple indication techniques like sma, rsi and bollinger bands. The user can see all 3 indicators in a chart on a web app, created with streamlit. The user can search for stocks with tickers and manually change the desired length of the development. The user can also see the rsi line in a seperate axis. Not only can the user use those indications with explanations given by the program, the program also creates a verdict over the state of a desired stock(buy,sell,hold) based on the 3 indicators.

The project is still under construction and still lacks finetuning, this is only a broad framework.
